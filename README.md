# FlowBench

A lightweight, backend-first workflow engine for composing LLM calls with real-world I/O operations.

Currently powers daily personal & work automation:
- Codebase analysis & review via file blob loading
- Self-generating & self-improving graph definitions
- Long-term memory chatbot with history & fact extraction
- PH news digests filtered for local impact
- and many more

### Core ideas
- JSON-defined graphs (no frontend visual editor yet)
- Pluggable node types: file read/write, API/RSS fetch, string templating and joining, LLM calls, etc.
- Dogfooding: uses its own source code as input for improvement loops
- Zero external orchestration frameworks (just Node.js + OpenAI-compatible APIs)

### Current status
- Backend-only, actively used every day since inception.
- Frontend graph editor (React Flow) is next.
- Mainly used with **xAI** and **LM Studio** models.

### Why this exists
I wanted a tool that could chain LLMs with files/APIs/memory without 50 dependencies or vendor lock-in for real, practical uses.  
Kept it fun, practical, and brutally simple.
